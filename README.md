# OpenCV Image Filters — Basics

This mini-project is part of my daily computer vision learning practice.

It loads an input image and applies a series of basic OpenCV operations:

- Grayscale conversion
- Gaussian blur
- Canny edge detection
- Binary thresholding

All outputs are saved into an `outputs/` folder.
