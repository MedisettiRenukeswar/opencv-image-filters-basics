# 🖼️ OpenCV Image Filters — Basics

This project demonstrates a complete **image filtering pipeline using OpenCV**.  
A sample input image is processed and exported into multiple filtered variants including grayscale, blur, edge detection, and binary threshold.

This repo is part of my **Computer Vision learning journey**, where I build small, practical projects and improve step by step.

## 🚀 Features

| Filter | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Original** | Loads the input image |
| **Grayscale** | Converts BGR → Gray |
| **Gaussian Blur** | Noise reduction using a 5×5 kernel |
| **Canny Edge Detection** | Extracts strong edges from the image |
| **Binary Threshold** | Converts grayscale into black–white mask |
